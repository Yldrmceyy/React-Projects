# React Geolocation Custom Hook

This project demonstrates how to create and use a custom hook (`useGeolocation`) in React to manage geolocation data efficiently.

## Features

- **Get Location:** Retrieves the user's geolocation (latitude and longitude) using the browser's Geolocation API.
- **State Management:** Tracks the loading state and handles errors during the geolocation process.
- **Map Link:** Provides a link to OpenStreetMap to view the user's location.
- **Reusable Hook:** Encapsulates geolocation logic into a reusable custom hook.
